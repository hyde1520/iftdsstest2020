        <h1 class="Heading1">About Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment (QWRA)</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Why Conduct a QWRA</h2>
        <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">Conducting a Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment (QWRA) can make land management decisions more effective by characterizing the predicted benefits and threats from fire on several, often overlapping, values across your landscape. This information can be used to plan fuel treatments, pre-plan suppression response, design fire effects monitoring programs, and other related management activities on a landscape while accounting for the predicted benefits and threats from fire and the relative importance of different landscape values.</span>
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Definition</h2>
        <p class="table-text"><span class="span_1">The "Risk Assessment” encompasses both threats and benefits from fire. Some resources may benefit from fire occurrence (i.e. fire dependent plant species) while others may be threatened (i.e. infrastructure).</span>
        </p>
        <p class="table-text">QWRA represents both losses and benefits resulting from fire and takes into account:</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Overview</h2>
        <p class="p_2"><span class="span_1">The Risk Assessment task in the IFTDSS Planning Cycle is the final stage of the Quantitative Wildfire Risk Assessment (QWRA) process.&#160; The entire process includes landscape creation and/or editing, modeling landscape burn probability, defining and evaluating highly valued resources or assets (HVRAs) and finally running a QWRA in order to evaluate the net threat or benefit of fire on a given landscape. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_3"><span class="span_1">Specifically, the QWRA interface relies on previous completion of the following in IFTDSS in order to be run: </span>
